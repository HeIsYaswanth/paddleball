Hello friends. I have developed my first challenging project of frontend development after almost 7 months of journey with lots of big breaks between due to lot of doubts. Now, I have made a small game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript purely. I made it mobile responsive. With this project probably I can say I am frontend developer.
